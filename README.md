# ALA Data Analyst Position - Visualisation Task

This code produces an informative visualisation based on a dataset (not included) provided by the Atlas of Living 
Australia. I chose to demonstrate the geospatial sampling intensity of the rainbow skink across the ACT. I had 
initially planned to examine an endangered species such as the striped legless lizard, however after initial results 
and determining that the dataset's coordinates were geographically truncated, resulting in a plot focused around two or 
three locations, I switched to a species with more entries.

Code has been split into two files: data_exploration.py and visualise.py.

Data_exploration.py contains code that demonstrates the investigation of the dataset, but was not related creating the 
plot.

Visualise.py contains the code that produces the plot.

## Results:

Results for the data exploration can be found in results.txt, and the completed visualisation can be found in 
result.png. 

## Requirements:

* Python 3
* Anaconda

## Setup:

These instructions are for running the code yourself, and are not necessary to view the results.

1. Create a new Conda virtual environment
2. Install the packages found in requirements.txt
3. Run `python data_exploration.py` or `python visualise.py` to test the code.
